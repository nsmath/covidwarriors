        <p><em>The</em> first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization
           declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic on 11 March 2020</p>
           <hr>
           <p>As of Sept, 2021, more than 3.3 crore cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in India  resulting in around 4.41 lakh deaths.
             Clearly, the corona virus outbreak situation cannot be taken lightly.</p>
          <hr>
             <p>Doctors and healthcare workers have been playing crucial role in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic
               for the last one and a half years. Many have lost their lives while treating Covid-19 patients worldwide.
                According to the Indian Medical Association, 798 doctors died during the second wave this year and
                748 doctors succumbed to Covid-19 in the first wave last year. On National Doctors' Day, the HealthSite
                salutes the heroes for their selfless services amid COVID-19 pandemic and honour their contribution to the society.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in these challenging times.
                   While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives at risk, the least we can do is
                   appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors.
                  That being said, it is good to see tributes pouring in for all the medical heroes working in scrubs.</p>
