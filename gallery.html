        <h1>Salute The COVID Heroes Who Selflessly <br>Helped India Fight COVID-19</h1>
        <div class="text0">
          <p>
            Doctors and healthcare workers have been playing crucial role in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic for the last one and a half years. Many have lost their lives while treating Covid-19 patients worldwide. According to the Indian Medical Association, 798 doctors died during the second wave this year and 748 doctors succumbed to Covid-19 in the first wave last year. On National Doctors' Day, the HealthSite salutes the heroes for their selfless services amid COVID-19 pandemic and honour their contribution to the society.<br> <br>
  Putting their own lives at risk with selfless determination for the sake of saving lives, they truly are our heroes in these challenging times. While they are putting their own health, families, and most importantly their own lives at risk, the least we can do is appreciate their efforts and cooperate by staying safe indoors. That being said, it is good to see tributes pouring in for all the medical heroes working in scrubs.
  <br><br> <b>We'd now like to highlight the heroic efforts of some courageous and inspiring doctors who lost their lives during this pandemic.</b>

              <p>26-year-old, Anas Mujahid, a junior Resident Doctor at Delhi’s COVID dedicated Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital is another COVID warrior India lost during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr Mujahid had minor symptoms like sore throat and tested positive in an antigen test at the hospital. In a rare case of sudden progression, he collapsed soon after and died due to intracranial bleeding. He is survived by his parents and four siblings. Talking about the sudden demise of Dr Mujahid, his friend and colleague Dr Aamir Sohail said,

              <br>"It was shocking for everyone who knew him. He had no comorbidity. He was a very dedicated doctor. He was planning to get the jab in the next few days."

                <p>In October, 70-year-old, Dr Jagadish Rai, an obstetrician and a general practitioner working in a small town in coastal Karnataka for the last 40 years, contracted COVID-19 in the line of duty and succumbed to the disease, setting another example of the selfless service that doctors and other healthcare workers offer. Despite being a senior citizen and having underlying leukemia, Dr Jagadish Rai continued to work six and a half days a week even during a pandemic. Dr Rai had his own clinic and was associated with a nursing home close by. He was not posted on COVID duty per se officially but continued seeing patients in his private practice, many of whom were COVID positive, who were denied medical attention elsewhere, shared Dr Rai’s daughter.
